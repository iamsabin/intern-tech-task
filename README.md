# Task

One of our clients has asked for an ecommerce system. The shop will need a shopping cart so that the customers can `add` and `remove` products before they purchase at checkout.

1) Create a Shopping Cart Class and any other classes that you see fit. 
(please create the branch - feature/shopping-cart)

The Shopping Cart Class should have a `cartId` to indentify the cart, `userId` to whom the cart belongs to, `products` to hold the products to be purchased.


2) Implement the functionality to add and remove products from the Shopping Cart.
(please create the branch - feature/shopping-cart-add-remove)

3) Create a sample unit-test for the add and remove functionality.
(please create the branch - feature/shopping-cart-add-remove-unit-tests)

By the end of this problem you should have 3 branches sequentially building on top of each other as you solve each task.
